# SSH-Copy-Disk
Bash script that makes a backup copy of a Linode's disk over SSH, then compresses the image  
Written by Tommy Davidson

Pretty straightforward - copies a disk over SSH by rebooting a Linode into Rescue Mode, and performing the instructions in Linode's guide on [Copying a Disk Over SSH](https://www.linode.com/docs/migrate-to-linode/disk-images/copying-a-disk-image-over-ssh). The script uses public key authentication, but sets a root password because SSH won't let you login if a password isn't set. You don't need this password for anything, and it can be safely ignored, since it's only relevant to Rescue Mode, and is unset when the script reboots the Linode at the end, anyway.

This script is tested, and confirmed to work on MacOS and Linux. It requires that the Linode CLIv4 be installed in order to reboot the Linode and to place it in Rescue Mode.

**Usage:**
```
copydisk.sh <Linode Label> <Linode Manager Username> <Datacenter> <-v|--verbose>
```

**Examples:**
```
copydisk.sh TestLinode username newark
copydisk.sh TestLinode2 username singapore -v
copydisk.sh TestLinode3 username tokyo2 --verbose
```

**Flags:**
- <Linode Label> - This is the name of the Linode to be copied.
- <Linode Manager Username> - This is the username you use to login to linode.com
- <Datacenter> - This is the datacenter your Linode resides in (see list below).
- <-v|--verbose> - Use either of these flags to put the script in verbose mode if you're having trouble.

**Supported Platforms:**
- MacOS
- Linux

**Dependencies:**
- [Linode CLIv4](https://www.linode.com/docs/platform/api/using-the-linode-cli/)

**Assumptions:**
- You have only one data disk in your Linode's Configuration Profile (swap disk is ignored by the script). I may update this later to account for multiple disk configurations, but I haven't considered what that will look like yet, so I don't know when.
- [Public Key Authentication](https://www.linode.com/docs/security/authentication/use-public-key-authentication-with-ssh/) is already configured on the machine that the script is running on.

**Recommendation:**
- Have [LISH](https://www.linode.com/docs/networking/using-the-linode-shell-lish/) open in another window when running the script. In the event of an error, this will help you determine what went wrong.

**Datacenters:**
- atlanta
- dallas
- fremont
- frankfurt
- london
- newark
- singapore
- tokyo2
